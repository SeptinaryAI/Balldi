# Balldi
Program of a spherical robot called Balldi, it is a funny IoT device. Its reference prototype is SAMSUNG company's Ballie.

It's just a personal project for fun !
You can refer to it, and you can freely use structural design, code, and circuit design of it, but I don't recommend you copying the entire Balldi.
It's so difficult to fully install it ！！
